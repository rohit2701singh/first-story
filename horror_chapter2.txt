In the heart of the forest, an old cabin stood, its timbers weathered and worn. Locals whispered of its cursed history, warning travelers to steer clear. Ignoring the warnings, Mark and his friends sought adventure and decided to spend a night there. As the night crept in, the forest grew silent, an eerie stillness settling over the cabin.

A faint tapping echoed from the attic, growing louder with each passing moment. Unease gripped them as they ascended the creaky stairs, the air thick with foreboding. The attic door swung open with a deafening creak, revealing a room draped in shadows.

In the flickering candlelight, they found an old journal, its pages filled with cryptic symbols and dark drawings. Suddenly, the door slammed shut, trapping them inside. Panic consumed them as the symbols on the pages began to glow, casting an eerie light around them.

Whispers filled the room, growing into a cacophony of voices. Shadows danced on the walls, taking sinister shapes. Desperate, they tried to break free, but the door remained sealed shut. As the night wore on, their sanity waned, the voices driving them to the brink of madness.

At dawn, the door creaked open, the cabin releasing them from its grip. Trembling and pale, they fled into the safety of the forest, haunted by the night they spent in the cursed cabin, never to return again.
