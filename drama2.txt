"Drama" can refer to a wide range of things depending on the context. It can mean a form of literature, such as plays or scripts written to be performed by actors. It can also refer to a genre of film, television, or literature characterized by conflict, emotional intensity, or a dramatic narrative style.

Outside of the arts, "drama" can be used to describe any situation that is characterized by conflict, tension, or heightened emotions, often used in a more colloquial sense to describe a situation that is filled with excitement, intensity, or unexpected developments. For example, someone might say, "There was so much drama at the party last night!" to describe a situation where there was a lot of tension or conflict among the people present.
