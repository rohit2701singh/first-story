Immanuel Kant:

"Two things awe me most, the starry sky above me and the moral law within me."
"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."
"Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life."
"All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason."
