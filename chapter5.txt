Friedrich Nietzsche:

"He who has a why to live can bear almost anyhow."
"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him."
"And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music."
"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself."
