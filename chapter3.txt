Ren√© Descartes:

"I think, therefore I am."
"Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it."
"The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries."
"If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things."
