In the abandoned mansion on the hill, whispers echoed through the halls like tortured souls. Many dared not approach, but Sarah was different. Drawn by a mysterious force, she stepped inside. Shadows danced in the flickering candlelight as she ventured deeper, the air thick with dread. Suddenly, a chilling breeze extinguished her light, plunging her into darkness. Panic gripped her as unseen hands seemed to pull her deeper into the abyss. A voice whispered her name, icy fingers grazing her skin. With trembling hands, she fumbled for her matches, but as the light returned, so did the ghastly sight before herâ€”a figure cloaked in darkness, eyes gleaming with malice. Frozen in terror, she watched as it advanced, each step a dreadful echo in her heart. The mansion had claimed another victim, its hunger unsated.
