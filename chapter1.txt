"The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

“I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.”
― Marilyn Monroe

“So many books, so little time.”
― Frank Zappa
